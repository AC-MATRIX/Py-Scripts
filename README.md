## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fork this repository to your account</br>

* Fork this repository by clicking on the `fork` button on the top of this page.
* This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

* Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

* Open a terminal and run the following git command:

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DSC-CETB/Py-Scripts.git

```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Now synchronize your forked repo

* It will help you to keep your forked repo updated with the original repo

```shell
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Now create a new branch

* Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```shell
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

_(The name of the branch does not need to have the word add in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)_

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Make necessary changes and commit those changes

* Open the folder in your local code editor and add your changes or modifications

* If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

* After making changes or modification on to your code locally, you need to add these files to the staging area. Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```shell
git add --all
```

* Once files added, you need to commit the changes to with an appropriate commit message using the `git commit` command:

```shell
git commit -m "<your-message>"
```

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Push changes to GitHub

* After committing the changes, you need to push the changes to master repo using `git push` command:

```shell
git push origin <your-created-branch-name>
```

replacing `<your-created-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Submit your changes for review

* Once you push the changes to your repository, the Compare & pull request button will appear in **GitHub**.</br>
* Go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button
<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

* Type a proper description and give the PR an appropriate title. 
* Finally, Open a pull request by clicking the `Create pull request` button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon we'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a `notification email` once the changes have been merged.

Congrats! You just completed the standard **fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request** workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor!
